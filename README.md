# Active Travel Infrastructure Platform

ATIP lets you sketch new plans for walking and cycling infrastructure with a
low level of detail. See the initial version at
<https://acteng.github.io/atip>.

## Development

We use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). You'll just need to set up
[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Then
run `npm install` once, and `npm run dev` after that.

To auto-format code, `npm run fmt`.
