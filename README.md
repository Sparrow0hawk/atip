# Active Travel Intervention Platform

A very early prototype, without explanation. Go play with <https://acteng.github.io/atip>.

## Development

Vanilla JS right now, no tooling. Just run `serve_locally.sh` and open your
browser to work on this locally.

## Dependencies

Install dependencies as follows, on Linux:

```
# Install Rust:
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install wasm-pack
cargo install wasm-pack
```
